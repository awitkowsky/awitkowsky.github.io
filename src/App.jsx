          <p>
            I've been building websites for a few years. I genuinely enjoy it,
            and I‚Äôd love to do it professionally someday.

          <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            Since I was a child, I‚Äôve been interested in technology and the
            animal world. I enjoy gaming and sports, but reptiles have truly
            stolen my heart. They‚Äôre fascinating, have unique personalities, and
            every day with them is something new.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have <strong>three crested geckos</strong> ‚Äì each with different
            colors and temperaments. One is very active, another is a typical
            ‚Äúnight owl,‚Äù and the third likes to sit in one place, staring at me
            like I‚Äôm from another planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a <strong>bearded dragon</strong> who is incredibly
            gentle and friendly. She loves basking under the UV lamp and
            watching what‚Äôs happening in the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            I dream of creating larger terrariums with natural decorations one
            day and sharing my knowledge about reptile care with other
            enthusiasts.
