        <p>
          I've been building websites for a few years. I genuinely enjoy it, and
          Iâ€™d love to do it professionally someday.

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          Since I was a child, Iâ€™ve been interested in technology and the animal
          world. I enjoy gaming and sports, but reptiles have truly stolen my
          heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have <strong>three crested geckos</strong> â€“ each with different
          colors and temperaments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have a <strong>bearded dragon</strong> who is incredibly gentle
          and friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dream of creating larger terrariums and sharing my knowledge with
          others.
        </p>
